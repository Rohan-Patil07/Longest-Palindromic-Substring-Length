## difference in longest and shortest palindromic substrings length
This Program takes strings as input and returns the difference between the longest and the shortest palindromic substrings of that String in the form of integer.

### Example 
 1)str = level
      longest palindromic substring or string length is 5
      shortest palindromic substring length is 1
      
      The function returns the difference in lengths i.e. 4
      
      
  2)str = abac
       longest palindromic substring length is 3
       shortest palindromic substring length is 1
       
       The function returns the difference in lengths i.e. 2
